# Finding-Donors-Project
 image classification,object detection, and face recognition,and so on, all based on deep learning models.


So, in this project,you'll be implementing an image classification application.This app will train a deep learning model on a data set of images,then use the trained model to classify images.First, developed a code ina Jupyter notebook to make sure your training implementation works.Then,converted the code toa Python application that runs from the command line.
